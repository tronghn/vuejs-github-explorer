# vuejs-github-explorer-blog
This repository contains the code for a fairly simple Vue.js webapp communicating with the GitHub API, allowing users to explore a given GitHub repository. 
 
Originally, the code was based on the [tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/create-a-github-file-explorer-using-vue-js) by [Alex Sears](https://twitter.com/searsaw). The project has since been rewritten and extended for learning purposes, e.g. using Webpack for preprocessing/bundling, Vuex for state management, as well as updating the app to work with Vue 2.0.

A live demo is available at: [https://tronghn.github.io/vuejs-github-explorer/](https://tronghn.github.io/vuejs-github-explorer/)

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies

```

For detailed explanation on the building and configuration process, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
